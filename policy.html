When a user submits their scores via the built-in submitter another key/value is set to remember the last successfully submitted score in order to avoid submitting repeated scores. Neither of these values is ever sent to the PCBvalues team without direct user consent.</p><h3>User submissions</h3><p>When a user submits their scores, the following data is collected:</p><ul><li>The username selected by the user (Under which their submission will appear).</li><li>Their full scores in all values.</li><li>The type of test taken (Full or Short).</li><li>The version of the test currently being submitted.</li><li>The SHA-512 hash in their URL's digest parameter.</li><li>The timestamp associated with the SHA-512 hash in the user's localStorage.</li><li>The number of timestamps in the user's localStorage (how many times the quiz has been taken).</li><li>The timestamp of the time the user's score was registered in the API server.</li><li>The user's browser's user agent string (for troubleshooting issues with other values and detecting spam).</li></ul><p>All of this data goes through a serverless backend running in Cloudflare's workers platform. None of this data is stored in any database in Cloudflare's server, being that it is directly formatted and sent to a Discord webhook, publicly available in the PCBValues server.</p><h3>Altering/Deleting submitted scores</h3><p> If a user wishes to have to have their scores altered or removed from the system they may join the PCBValues discord and contact with an element of the development team, they will assess the validity of the request and take the necessary actions.</p><h3>Storing and selection of the submitted scores</h3><p>The scores submitted by the users are sent to the publicly available webhook in the PCBValues Discord server, the PCBValues team analyses each score to determine their validity and according to its perceived validity will add it to the SQLite database in the repository's db directory. Whenever a new build of the test is prepared the quiz's automated build scripts will read all the scores in the database and output them to a single JSON file called users.json, stored in the dist directory. Due to the manual vetting process the submitted scores will not be visible right away, only after a new build of the quiz is pushed to GitHub, containing updated scores, will their scores go live and be available in the gallery and as a match on the results page.</p></div></body></html>
